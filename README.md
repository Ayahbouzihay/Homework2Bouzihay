## Reflection on Resources

In completing this project, I found generative AI tools like ChatGPT to be incredibly useful for generating content and refining project documentation. Additionally, resources such as online tutorials, documentation, and coding forums were invaluable for overcoming technical challenges and enhancing our development skills. While generative AI provided helpful insights, human judgment and critical thinking were essential for interpreting and applying the generated content effectively.
